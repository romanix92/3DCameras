@mainpage FastCV Public API Documentation

@version 1.1.1

@section Overview Overview

FastCV provides two main features to computer vision application developers:
   - First, it provides a library of  frequently used computer vision (CV)
   functions, optimized to run efficiently on mobile devices.
   - Second, it provides a clean processor-agnostic hardware acceleration API,
   under which  chipset vendors can hardware accelerate FastCV functions on
   their hardware.

This initial release (FastCV 1.0) only supports Android mobile developers;
however, we intend to support iOS and Windows devices as soon as possible.
FastCV 1.0 is available for download for free from developer.qualcomm.com.

FastCV 1.0 is released as a unified binary, a single binary containing two
implementations of the library.
   - The first implementation runs on any ARM processor, and is referred to as
   the "FastCV for ARM."
   - The second implementation runs only on Qualcomm Snapdragon S2 and higher
   chipsets, and is called "FastCV for Snapdragon."

Releases are generally motivated for the following reasons:
   - Changes to previously released APIs
   - Addition of new functions
   - Performance improvements and/or bug fixes - also known as implementation 
     modifications

    Each motivation has a varying degree of impact on the user of the library.
    The general release numbering scheme captures this variety of motivations.

    Given release ID: A.B.C

    An increase in "A" indicates that a previously released API has changed, 
    so a developer may encounter compilation issues which require modification 
    of their code in order to adhear to the modified API.  Qualcomm will make 
    every effort to minimize these changes.  Additionally, new functions and 
    implementation modifications may be present.

    An increase in "B" indicates that new functions have been added to the 
    library, so additional functionality is available, however existing APIs 
    have not changed.  Additionally, implementation modifications may be 
    present.

    An increase in "C" indicates that implementation modifications only have 
    been made.

/// @brief
///   find nearest neighbors (NN) for query
///
/// @details
///   Assuming KD tree creation is successful we may start using our kdTree
///   for nearest neighbors (NN) for descriptors of camera features. Let our
///   camera descriptors be in array camDescriptors and their number
///   in numCamDescriptors
///
///      int8_t* camDescriptors;
///      int numCamDescriptors;
///
///   we compute their inverse lengths as floating point numbers and provide
///   them in
///
///      float* camDescriptorsInvLengths;
///         
///   now for each camera descriptor we may search for its NNs among
///   target image descriptors. Assume we want to find 8 NNs for each camera
///   descriptor. We declare variables for results of NN searches
///
///      #define NUM_NN 8                 // number of NN required
///      #define MAX_CHECKS 32            // max number of checks in kdtree
///
///      int32_t numFound = 0;            // for numer of NNs found
///      int32_t foundInds[ NUM_NN ];     // for indices to target descriptors
///      float32_t foundDists[ NUM_NN ];  // for distances to target descriptors
///      float32_t maxDist = 0.1f;        // max distance to query allowed
///      
///   the search for NNs for i-th query would be like this
///
///      err = fcvKDTreeQuery36s8f32( kdTree, camDescriptors + i * 36, 
///            camDescriptorsInvLengths[ i ], maxDist, MAX_CHECKS, 0,
///            &numFound, foundInds, foundDists );
///
///   where maxDists is an upper bound on distance of NN from the query
///   and MAX_CHECKS is max number of comparisons of query to target
///   descriptors. The higher MAX_CHECKS the better NNs we get at the cost
///   of longer search. Assuming everything went fine will return us
///   search results. numFound will contain the number of target descriptors
///   found whose distance to query is less than maxDist. foundInds will
///   contain indices to target descriptors being NNs and foundDists their
///   distances to query.
